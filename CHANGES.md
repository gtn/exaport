* Major changes due to code review. This version is not compatible with previous versions. We will provide an update script for everyone who wants to update from older versions as soon as possible (during january 2008).
* Directory of whole portfolio-plugin is now blocks/exabis_eportfolio
* Language packs are now in blocks/exabis_eportfolio/lang/
* Language packs were renamed to block_exabis_eportfolio.php
* Block was renamed to exabis_eportfolio
* All the tables start with blocexabepor
* Added foreign table keys and indexes
* Removed backticks in sql statements
* Removed combination of NOTNULL="false" and DEFAULT="0"
* Removed nonstandard code instead of addslashes at import
* Changed directory for files to moodledata/exabis_eportfolio
* Implemented portfoliofile.php, which is a simplified version of file.php and has special protection for portfolio files
* removed non-XHTML compliant code
* removed hardcoded CSS
* removed uninitialized variables
* used PARAM_TEXT for category names
* timemodified reads time() after passing the formular data
* used prefix for functions in lib.php files
* Used fullname()
* Removed hardcoded charset=iso-8859-1 in export.php file
* Eportfolio block allowed on the front page now
* Used CONTEXT_SYSTEM for the capabilities and legacy user. If you want to change the rights from specific users you have to define a global role and unset the specific capability.
* Split up add_file.php into add_file.php and add_file_from_moodleimport.php and checked if the user is allowed to add this file (when importing from an assignment)
* Typos and other minor problems
* localized alt-tags
* Shortened table names
* XSS issues in portfoliofile.php and external links
* Removed possible SQL injection at import
* Corrected typos and coding errors
* Improved general accesssibility
* When using the block on the frontpage the double site link navigation was removed
* Form's definition() doesn't use existing data
* Removed redirects
* Removed the use of $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']
* The exabis_eportfolio:import-capability is now not set - the system administrator has to deside whether he wants to allow import or not.
* Block title is now in language-file

### 2007-11-29 Version 2.03 ###

* Changed name of language-file. bookmark.php is now exabisportfolio.php
* Cleaned up the code
* Removed all PARAM_RAW (except in one case where I do a manual check)
* Rewrote SQL for both MySQL and PostgreSQL (use of XMLDB, applied rules for SQL)
* Removed all global variables except the ones defined from Moodle
* Changed directory portfolio/ to eportfolio/
* Added $CFG->dirroot before require_once, require, include, include_once and before links.
* Removed bug: when deleting a categorie the entries weren't deleted.
* Set the Import-Capabilitiy default to off because the import may be a security risk.

### 2007-11-12 Version 2.02 ###

* Removed bug when exporting external portfolios (comment-column was not created when you didn't update the plugin)
* When sharing a portfolio entry your own name is now shown.
* Problem with not finding the mimeinfo()-function (white page when editing a file portfolio entry)
* Added capability system. Comment: The Exabis ePortfolio-rights have to be set globally (Assign global roles). Comment: the capability shareextern needs shareintern. You can only share extern if both shareintern and shareextern are set. allowposts is used to prevents posts on other (shared) bookmarks. You can always post on your own bookmark.
* Changed directory structure: put all the code inside eportfolio/. You can delete the direcotries bookmark/ and portfolio_export/ that were needed in previous installations. Please delete them after installing the new version.
* Removed direcory files/ and the file inside (mimetypes.php) because moodle is capable of the function mimetypes(). This file is not needed any more.
* Changes place where the exported SCORM-files (.zip) are saved. Put that back into the course-directories because elsewhere they would not be accessable with file.php.
* Comment: Didn't change place where the files of the bookmark are saved: Advantages:
    * Files are accessible now
    * This version is compatible with previous versions <= 2.01 Disadvantage:
    * When a course is deleted the portfolio-files that were uploaded within this course are also deleted. Unfortunately there is no other way to implement this at the moment. The whole thing is a limitation of moodle that files can only be accessed within course-directories (with file.php). I heard of plans to solve this problems in future moodle versions. If anyone knows a better solution please tell me :)
* Changed location of images to eportfolio/pix because there were problems one some installations.

### 2007-08-05 Version 2.01 ###

* Added require_login at the external portfolio. Guest user is allowed to, so if you want that a user who hasn't a login is automatically logged in as guest you have to set $CFG->autologinguests to 1
* Fixed problems with external links (the url was preceded with $CFG->wwwroot)
* Fixed breadcrumbs at import/export
* Added some language strings and removed hardcoded strings.
* Removed bug that the bookmark entries were not shown anymore when the course was deleted.
* Added column for Course name at the moodle-intern import.

### 2007-07-24 Version 2.00 ###

* Added pix\i\desc.gif because in Moodle 1.8 this image is missing.
* Minor changes in nearly all files (e.g. replaces

* )
* UI changes in view* and share* - files
* Partially reprogramming of view* and shar* - files
* Added external access for files

* Added comment-function to all files, external links and notes when the user is viewing them (removed direct linking to files or links)
* changed most of the forms to formslib
* Block should not be shown on the start page of moodle - the paths were incorrect there. You should see the Block only when a course is selected.
