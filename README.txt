As with any customization, it is recommended that you have a good backup of your Moodle site before attempting to install
contributed code.
While those contributing code make every effort to provide the best code that they can, using contributed code nevertheless
entails a certain degree of risk as contributed code is not as carefully reviewed and/or tested as the Moodle core code.
Hence, use this block at your own risk.

their artefacts with educational standards. These standards are linked to Moodle via the exabis-competencies Block

The XML-file can be generated with any tool, gtn gmbh has made available a tool as a Typo3-extension which can be downloaded at:
